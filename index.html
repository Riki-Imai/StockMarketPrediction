        <h2>Outline</h2>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
       <p>Predicting the stock markets movements are of great interest for hedge fund, quants fund and also investors. 
         Financial Securities firms try to develop algorithms that automatically trades with information from news articles, 
         data, and market trends. Some hedge/quants funds experience an increase in their markets, and computational analysis 
         is developing rapidly. (Note that, it is nearly impossible to deal with outliers with algorithms or neural networks, 
         known as "Black Swan" market theory. Also as presented in "random walk theory," it is impossible to predict the precise 
         price movement with a huge amount of noises.)
      </p>

      <h3>Background:</h3>
      <p>Automating the Prediction of stock market fluctuations has been a difficult matter to a lot of companies trying to do 
        so, mainly because of the amount of factors that can affect stock changes and make predicting them perfectly nearly impossible.
        For example, Eli Lily’s stock dived down after a fake twitter account impersonating them tweeted with the promise of free insulin. 
        Such events create the difficulty of predicting daily stock changes.
      </p>

      <h3>Transition:</h3>
      <p>The main issue with predicting the stock market is that it does not always follow quantitative data, and changes seem illogical a 
        lot of times. The problem with this is there is not a publicly available solution to this issue, and hedge funds cannot reveal their 
        strategies to deal with this seemingly-illogical behavior as it is their method of making money. In this project, we will research more 
        about this behavior and try to increase our accuracy by attempting to include this behavior in our model.
      </p>

      <h3>Details:</h3>
      <p>One of the technical challenges that we will have to overcome is finding an accurate dataset as our prediction model heavily depends 
        on the completeness of the dataset. Finding a perfect dataset will be difficult but crucial to the project.
      </p>

      <h3>Assessment:</h3>
      <p>Our main goal is to achieve a working model while maximizing the accuracy as much as we can. If time allows, we would like to 
        try our model on actual stock markets with this website (https://www.marketwatch.com/games).

      <h3>General Questions:</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Should we even be doing this?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>It will be useful to see how the company might grow and 
                  analyze what the audience thinks about the company, because
                  stock markets are where all the opinions and information will
                  merge and be reflected.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What might be the accuracy of a simple non-ML alternative?</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>50%</li>
          </ul>
        <li>What processes will we use to handle appeals/mistakes?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>By nature, there are a lot of imperfections with trying to 
                predict the stock market (“random walk theory”). However, we 
                will try to get the most accurate average prediction line we 
                can get.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>How diverse is our team?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>Everyone comes from the different background and interests.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

      <h3>Data Questions:</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Is our data valid for its intended use?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>There is the Public Datasets (PDS) that has actual markets data, 
                such as JPX and Deutsche Börse Public Dataset, which is publicly 
                accessible and can be used in the research as seen in 
                https://www.originate.com/thinking/predicting-stock-market-movements-using-a-neural-network
          </li>
            </ul>
        <li>What bias could be in our data? (All data contains bias.)</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Not biased with the data itself, but data itself contains “bias”, but 
                  does not seem impactful in nature; the stock price moves with selling/buying
                  the stocks, which are done by humans with bias.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>How could we minimize bias in our data and model?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>We do not do anything to minimize bias in our data since the stock 
                market already reflects these in themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>How should we “audit” our code and data?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>By setting code reviews after each major progress point for the project.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>


      <h3>Impact Questions:</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Do we expect different error rates for different sub-groups in the data?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>We expect there is a variety of movement patterns depending on the industry 
                and companies’ stocks that we will look for in nature. For this reason, we will 
                first try to focus on a handful of companies in a single industry and expand the 
                number possibly.
          </li>
            </ul>
        <li>What are likely misinterpretations of the results and what can be done to prevent those misinterpretations?</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Stock market data contains noises. By this nature, we might misinterpret 
                  the randomness of data as “predicting correctly.” To avoid this, we will 
                  mention how financial markets can be random sometimes by sharing some theories 
                  established.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>How might we impinge individuals' privacy and/or anonymity?</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>The stock market prices do not reflect anyone’s privacy and are kept anonymous 
                since there is no way to tell who makes the trading from quantitative stock market data.
          </li>
        </ul>
       </ul>

          Predicting Stock Market Movements Using A Neural Network Applied To The Deutsche Börse Public Dataset</a></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Using a neural network onto the Public Dataset (PDS), Deutsche Börse Public Dataset, 
            they implemented a neural network model to predict future movements of stock prices using trends 
            from the previous 10 minutes. Although the dataset for stock markets is provided on a minute-to-minute 
            basis, it usually contains a lot of noises in data in order to predict the trend; they averaged 10 
            1-minute data into a single datapoint in order to avoid these noises.

          Application of Artificial Neural Network for stock market predictions: A review of literature</a></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Neural networks can be used for stock price prediction: The article proposes the use of artificial 
            neural networks (ANNs) to predict stock prices, as ANNs are able to recognize patterns and trends in 
            data, and can be trained to make accurate predictions based on past performance. Different architectures
            and parameters can affect prediction accuracy: The article notes that the accuracy of ANNs in predicting
            stock prices is affected by various factors such as the architecture of the network, the number of hidden 
            layers and nodes, and the activation function used. Accuracy can be improved by incorporating more data: 
            The article suggests that incorporating more data such as news and social media sentiment, economic indicators, 
            and company financial reports can improve the accuracy of stock price predictions, and highlights the need for 
            ongoing research in this area.

            ANN models on stock price prediction and finds that certain models, such as the backpropagation neural network 
            (BPNN), are better at predicting stock prices than others. Accurate prediction depends on careful selection of 
            input variables: The article notes that selecting the appropriate input variables, such as stock prices, trading
            volumes, and economic indicators, is crucial for accurate stock price prediction using ANNs, and suggests that 
            combining multiple models and input variables can lead to more accurate predictions.
