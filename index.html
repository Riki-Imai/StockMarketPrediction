    <h1>1. Introduction</h1><br>
    <br>
     <br>
      <br>
      This Introduction presents several studies that have explored the use of neural networks for stock 
      market prediction. The studies aim to improve the accuracy of predictions and investigate different 
      approaches to feature engineering, network architectures, and training algorithms.<br><br><br>
     
     Stock market prediction has always been a topic of interest for investors, financial analysts, and 
      researchers. In recent years, with the growth of machine learning and deep learning, the use of neural 
      networks for stock market prediction has gained significant attention. Neural networks are computational 
      models that can be trained to recognize patterns and trends in data and can be used to make predictions
      based on past performance.
     <br><br>
     Also, the financial Securities firms try to develop algorithms that automatically trades with information from news articles, 
         data, and market trends. Some hedge/quants funds experience an increase in their markets, and computational analysis 
         is developing rapidly. (Note that, it is nearly impossible to deal with outliers with algorithms or neural networks, 
         known as "Black Swan" market theory. Also as presented in "random walk theory," it is impossible to predict the precise 
         price movement with a huge amount of noises.)
     <br><br>
     Automating the Prediction of stock market fluctuations has been a difficult matter to a lot of companies trying to do 
        so, mainly because of the amount of factors that can affect stock changes and make predicting them perfectly nearly impossible.
        For example, Eli Lily’s stock dived down after a fake twitter account impersonating them tweeted with the promise of free insulin. 
        Such events create the difficulty of predicting daily stock changes.
     <br><br>
     The main issue with predicting the stock market is that it does not always follow quantitative data, and changes seem illogical a 
        lot of times. The problem with this is there is not a publicly available solution to this issue, and hedge funds cannot reveal their 
        strategies to deal with this seemingly-illogical behavior as it is their method of making money. In this project, we will research more 
        about this behavior and try to increase our accuracy by attempting to include this behavior in our model.
     <br><br>
     One of the technical challenges that we will have to overcome is finding an accurate dataset as our prediction model heavily depends 
        on the completeness of the dataset. Finding a perfect dataset will be difficult but crucial to the project. Some articles (Shen & Shafiq, 2020)
     suggests a comprehensive way of predicting stock market prices by incorporating the factors such as social media sentiment, economic indicators, 
     and company financial reports.
     <br><br>
     Our main goal is to achieve a working model while maximizing the accuracy as much as we can. If time allows, we would like to 
        try our model on actual stock markets with this website (https://www.marketwatch.com/games).

    <h1>2. Related Works</h1>
   <br><br>
A study by Originate. (<a href="https://www.originate.com/thinking/predicting-stock-market-movements-using-a-neural-network">
     https://www.originate.com/thinking/predicting-stock-market-movements-using-a-neural-network</a>) utilized 
     a neural network model to predict future, 20-minutes ahead, movements of stock prices by averaging ten 1-minute data into
     a single point in order to avoid noises in the datasets. Similarly, Vijh et al. in 2020 investigated the neural networks 
     and random forest techniques to predict future closing prices for stocks and evaluated the method using standard strategic 
     indicators such as RMSE and MAPE.
<br><br>
The use of Bayesian neural networks is also useful to predict stock market prices during high volatility times, during the 
     Covid-19 pandemic (Chandra & He, 2021), not only providing reasonable predictions of stock market prices, but also quantifying
     the uncertainty of the predictions.
<br><br>
Historically, there are various ways to predict the stock markets as we have developed algorithms and CS. The research in 2010 
     (Naeini et al., 2010) provides two ways of predicting the stock market prices. One is a feed-forward MLP and another is an 
     Elman recurrent network, with a back-propagation algorithm being used to train them. The study found that the feed-forward 
     MLP network more accurately predicted the direction and amount of change as of 2010.
<br><br>
Finally, the two articles (RK & DD, 2010; Devadoss & Ligori, 2013) discuss Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and highlight the 
     importance of careful selection of input variables and network architecture for accurate predictions. The article by Devadoss 
     & Ligori compares the performance of different ANN models on stock price prediction and finds that certain models, such as the 
     backpropagation neural network (BPNN), are better at predicting stock prices than others, which adds new aspect to the research 
     by Naeini et al. in 2010 where they found the feed-forward MLP network was better predicting the direction and amount of changes 
     compared to an Elman recurrent network.
<br><br>
In addition, Shen & Shafiq in 2020 provided a holistic view of predicting stock markets with the emergence of big data and deep 
     learning. The proposed solution utilized pre-processing of the stock market dataset, utilization of multiple feature engineering
     techniques, combined with a customized deep learning based system for stock market precise trend prediction, opening up the ways 
     to achieve high accuracy for stock market prediction by incorporating factors such as social media sentiment, economic indicators, 
     and company financial reports. It suggests that there is a need for ongoing research in this area.
<br><br>
Overall, the studies in this realm provide insights into different approaches to feature engineering, network architectures, ]
     and training algorithms for stock market prediction using neural networks. The findings of these studies can inform future 
     research in this field and contribute to the development of more accurate and effective prediction models for stock market movements.
