    <h1>1. Introduction</h1><br>
    <br>
     Stock market prediction has always been a topic of interest for investors, financial analysts, and 
      researchers. In recent years, with the growth of machine learning and deep learning, the use of neural 
      networks for stock market prediction has gained significant attention. Neural networks are computational 
      models that can be trained to recognize patterns and trends in data and can be used to make predictions
      based on past performance.<br>
      <br>
      This Introduction presents several studies that have explored the use of neural networks for stock 
      market prediction. The studies aim to improve the accuracy of predictions and investigate different 
      approaches to feature engineering, network architectures, and training algorithms.<br><br>
     
     <h2>Outline</h2>
      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
       <p>Predicting the stock markets movements are of great interest for hedge fund, quants fund and also investors. 
         Financial Securities firms try to develop algorithms that automatically trades with information from news articles, 
         data, and market trends. Some hedge/quants funds experience an increase in their markets, and computational analysis 
         is developing rapidly. (Note that, it is nearly impossible to deal with outliers with algorithms or neural networks, 
         known as "Black Swan" market theory. Also as presented in "random walk theory," it is impossible to predict the precise 
         price movement with a huge amount of noises.)
      </p>

      <h3>Background:</h3>
      <p>Automating the Prediction of stock market fluctuations has been a difficult matter to a lot of companies trying to do 
        so, mainly because of the amount of factors that can affect stock changes and make predicting them perfectly nearly impossible.
        For example, Eli Lily’s stock dived down after a fake twitter account impersonating them tweeted with the promise of free insulin. 
        Such events create the difficulty of predicting daily stock changes.
      </p>

      <h3>Transition:</h3>
      <p>The main issue with predicting the stock market is that it does not always follow quantitative data, and changes seem illogical a 
        lot of times. The problem with this is there is not a publicly available solution to this issue, and hedge funds cannot reveal their 
        strategies to deal with this seemingly-illogical behavior as it is their method of making money. In this project, we will research more 
        about this behavior and try to increase our accuracy by attempting to include this behavior in our model.
      </p>

      <h3>Details:</h3>
      <p>One of the technical challenges that we will have to overcome is finding an accurate dataset as our prediction model heavily depends 
        on the completeness of the dataset. Finding a perfect dataset will be difficult but crucial to the project.
      </p>

      <h3>Assessment:</h3>
      <p>Our main goal is to achieve a working model while maximizing the accuracy as much as we can. If time allows, we would like to 
        try our model on actual stock markets with this website (https://www.marketwatch.com/games).

    In a study conducted by Deutsche Börse Public Dataset, the authors used a neural network model to 
      predict future movements of stock prices by averaging ten 1-minute data into a single datapoint in 
      order to avoid noise in the data. Similarly, the article by Sciencedirect utilized neural networks 
      and random forest techniques to predict future closing prices for stocks and evaluated the method 
      using standard strategic indicators such as RMSE and MAPE.
       <br><br>
      The use of Bayesian neural networks was explored by the study presented in PLOS ONE, where 
      the authors aimed to predict stock market prices during high volatility utilizing data gathered 
      uring the Covid-19 pandemic. They found that the Bayesian neural network not only provided reasonable 
      predictions of stock market prices but also quantified the uncertainty of the predictions.
       <br><br>
      The research article presented in ResearchGate experimented with two ways of predicting stock market 
      prices using a feed-forward MLP and an Elman recurrent network, with a back-propagation algorithm being 
      used to train those networks. The study found that the feed-forward MLP network more accurately predicted 
      the direction and amount of change.
       <br><br>
      Finally, the two articles presented in Application of Artificial Neural Network for stock market predictions: 
      A review of literature and Citeseerx proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for stock price 
      prediction. Both articles highlight the importance of careful selection of input variables and network
      architecture for accurate predictions. The article in Citeseerx compares the performance of different 
      ANN models on stock price prediction and finds that certain models, such as the backpropagation neural 
      network (BPNN), are better at predicting stock prices than others.
       <br><br>
      In addition, the review article in Application of Artificial Neural Network for stock market predictions 
      emphasizes the need for incorporating more data such as news and social media sentiment, economic indicators, 
      and company financial reports to improve the accuracy of stock price predictions. This suggests that there is a 
      need for ongoing research in this area.
       <br><br>
      Overall, the studies presented in references provide insights into different 
      approaches to feature engineering, network architectures, and training algorithms for stock market
      prediction using neural networks. The findings of these studies can inform future research in this 
      field and contribute to the development of more accurate and effective prediction models for stock market movements.
